When you make your daily preparations, you can outfit your armor with a single reinforcement. The reinforcement stays attached until the next time you make daily preparations. Dismantling a reinforcement renders it useless, and you cannot install another reinforcement until you make your daily preparations. Unless otherwise stated, all reinforcements increase the bulk of your armor by 1.\nBecause reinforcements are so cumbersome, others are untrained in any armor with a reinforcement attached. Furthermore, many reinforcements require specific tools and materials to make. As a result, they are Uncommon in most parts of the world"
