You realize that the best defense is, in fact, a good defense. Shrugging off hits from all directions, you aim to protect your teammates by becoming an immovable object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>&nbsp;DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS&hellip;</h2>\n<p>You are the first one in and the last one out, ensuring that your teammates are safe from harm.</p>\n<h2>DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS&hellip;</h2>\n<p>You act as a mediator, ensuring discussions don't get too heated.</p>\n<h2>WHILE EXPLORING&hellip;</h2>\n<p>You take point, ready to intercept any incoming attacks.</p>\n<h2>IN DOWNTIME&hellip;</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You polish your armor, or maybe craft some of your own. You also might act as a bodyguard.</p>\n<h2>YOU MIGHT&hellip;</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Want to verify that everyone is prepared before adventuring.</li>\n<li>Study different kinds of alloys to augment your defenses.</li>\n<li>Overly focus on just defense, and neglect other areas of combat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>OTHERS PROBABLY&hellip;</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Rely on you to keep them safe.</li>\n<li>Scoff at your dedication to defense instead of offense.</li>\n<li>Think you might have put up barriers other than just physical ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ANCESTRIES AND BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>\n<h2>BULWARK OF BURDEN</h2>\n<p>Your physical endurance allows you to carry more than normally possible. You may substitute your Constitution score for your Strength score for the purposes of determining your armor check penalty. Increase your maximum and encumbered Bulk limits by 2.</p>\n<h2>INITIAL PROFICIENCIES</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>INTERPOSE</h2>\n<p>You put yourself in the line of fire, taking damage for teammates. You gain the Interpose reaction.</p>\n<h2>IRONCLAD FEATS</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an ironclad class feat.</p>\n<h2>PROTOCOL</h2>\n<p>When you chose to become an ironclad, you established a protocol - your personal method of protecting your teammates. Your protocol gives you training in a skill, as well as an additional benefit. Choose a protocol.</p>\n<h3>ARMORED ARTIFICER</h3>\n<p>You are a sharp armorer, keeping your tools in perfect condition at all times. You&rsquo;re trained in Crafting. Your shield&rsquo;s hardness increases by 2.</p>\n<h3>MOBILE FORTRESS</h3>\n<p>You ensure that you can stay near your allies at all times. You&rsquo;re trained in Acrobatics. When wearing heavy armor, if you meet the Strength requirement, instead of reducing the movement penalty by 5 feet, you reduce the penalty by 10 feet (typically reducing the penalty to 0). If you are a dwarf with the Unburdened Iron feat, increase your Speed by 5 feet.</p>\n<h3>PERPETUAL PROTECTOR</h3>\n<p>You are ever-ready, maintaining vigilance at all times - even when resting. You&rsquo;re trained in Survival. Allies within 30 feet gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative checks. Additionally, you can sleep normally in medium and heavy armor.</p>\n<h2>SHIELD BLOCK</h2>\n<p>You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>SKILL FEATS 2ND</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>DENY ADVANTAGE 3RD</h2>\n<p>Your foes struggle to pass your defenses. You aren&rsquo;t flatfooted to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.</p>\n<h2>GENERAL FEATS 3RD</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>SKILL INCREASES 3RD</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you&rsquo;re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you&rsquo;re already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you&rsquo;re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you&rsquo;re already a master.</p>\n<h2>ABILITY BOOSTS 5TH</h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it&rsquo;s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>ANCESTRY FEATS 5TH</h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you&rsquo;re a master, and to 4 if you&rsquo;re legendary.</p>\n<h2>IRONCLAD EXPERTISE 9TH</h2>\n<p>You've reinforced your mettle, as well as your armor. Your class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>LIGHTNING REFLEXES 9TH</h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast.

Armor that you wear can benefit from an additional property rune.</p>\n<h3>MOBILE FORTRESS</h3>\n<p>Nothing can hinder your movement. You can ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain. As normal for ignoring difficult terrain, this also lets you treat the hindrances of greater difficult terrain as those of difficult terrain.</p>\n<h3>PERPETUAL PROTECTOR</h3>\n<p>Your vigilance prepares you for conflict on the horizon. You can take reactions even if you haven't acted in combat. The circumstance bonus to initiative for allies within 30 feet of you increases to +2.
